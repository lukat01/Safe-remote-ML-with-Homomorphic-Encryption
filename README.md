This is an implementation of a web application used for safe trainging and evaluation of Logistic Regression ML model using Homomorphic encryption, based on [TenSEAL Tutorial Part 1](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL/blob/main/tutorials%2FTutorial%201%20-%20Training%20and%20Evaluation%20of%20Logistic%20Regression%20on%20Encrypted%20Data.ipynb). The web app is created in Python Flask environment and for homomorphic encryption the tenseal library is used.

Anaconda Python 3.9 virtual environment is used for development.
